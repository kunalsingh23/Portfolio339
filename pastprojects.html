      <h2>Cubs Business Analytics</h2>
      <p id = 'cubs-tb'>After my sophomore year at Michigan, I was a business analytics intern for Wrigley Field in Chicago. I created a model in Python to forecast sales and purchasing habits of consumers at Wrigley field on a game-by-game basis. <br> The model found the 5-most similar past events using Euclidean distance and generated roughly 5 Million dollars in revenue. The model outputs optimal prices for foods and beverages at an event with given parameters.</p></div>
      
      <div class = 'cubs-img'><img src = 'images/cubs.jpg' alt = 'Wrigley Field'></div>

      <div class='mich'>
      <h2>Michigan Basketball</h2>
      <p id = 'mich-tb'>Sophomore and Junior year, I worked for the Michigan Men's basketball team for 3 semesters. A team of 3 students and myself analyzed tracking data from the Michigan basketball team to aid athlete injury prevention, optimize training, and provide on-court improvements using Python and R. We developed models that efficiently sorted large scale data in hopes of helping trainers and coaches effectively manage their athleteâ€™s workloads.</p></div>
      <div class = 'mich-img'><img src = 'images/michigan.jpg' alt = 'Michigan Basketball'></div>

      <div class='athletics'>

      <h2>Oakland Athletics</h2>
      <p id = 'athletics-tb'>I worked directly under Asst. GM (Dan Kantrovitz) on multiple projects that sought to analyze and value major league and minor league players using both Python and SQL. <br> Used ML opics such as K-Means Clustering, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Classifiers to analyze, re-classify, and uniquely evaluate pitchers based on the advanced characteristics of their pitches through Statcast/Trackman data.</p></div>
      <div class = 'athletics-img'><img src = 'images/athletics.jpg' alt = 'Athletics Logo'></div>

      <div class='future'>

      <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
      <p id = 'future-tb'>As my work experience shows, I have worked a lot in sports. At the end of the day, my ultimate goal is to work in the front office of a footall team. I think football is fascinating from an analytical standpoint given that the game comes to a complete stop after every play, but there are 22 moving variables once the play starts. <br>This presents a lot of challenges but also so much opportunity for creativity. I am particularly interested in personal analysis as well as play design analysis.</p></div>
